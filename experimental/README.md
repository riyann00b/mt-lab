# Experimental

This space captures prototypes, proof-of-concept notes, and early-stage experiments for MT Labs’ digital operations stack.

## Purpose

- Trial new integrations or automation ideas before they are promoted to the main stack.
- Document findings, caveats, and next steps while the work is still exploratory.
- Keep experimental artifacts isolated so production guides stay clean.

## Workflow

1. Create a subfolder per experiment (e.g., `erpnext-rabbitmq/`, `paperless-ai-tagging/`).
2. Drop quick notes or mini-guides in Markdown to record what you tried and why.
3. When an experiment graduates, move the final documentation into the appropriate service directory and archive the prototype here if reference material is still useful.
