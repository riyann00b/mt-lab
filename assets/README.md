# Assets

Central repository for MT Labs visual collateral and media references. Materials stored here support documentation, ERPNext print formats, and future UI/communications work.

## Structure

- `branding/` — Source artwork, color references, and exported variants for the MT Labs identity system.

Additional subfolders can be added as new asset families are introduced; keep naming consistent so cross-references in `docs/` remain unambiguous.
